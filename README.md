This project is a short availability in public just for evaluation purposes. 

## üöÖ Test showcasing (experiment)

 - [x] I noticed, the form fields for the different pages (`Residential`, `Property` and `Employment`) had in common the typical fields of an address.
 - [x] `Employment` form was more challenging in order to handle employee `Type`(Student, Retired and Employed).
 - [x] Each `Page`has a same context itself, but the form behaviour changes according to form expected for each page.
 - [x] I used the `props` native capability to pass `context` from `Page` to `AddressesForm` and avoid complex code.
 - [x] I added a `Main` page as a simulation of basic information form gathering, in order to summary at the end, more real as expected. 

## üßê More time (research ), could be possible:
- [x] Using Atomic Design Methodology [(Author Brad Frost)](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), will be possible to potentialize the modularity of Components,  and make posible the a design system for üè¶ Scotia Bank exclusivity.
- [x] `AddressesForm`more granular and re-useable component.
- [x] Fields validations were one of most challenging part of the test, but I accomplished nicely for the test.
